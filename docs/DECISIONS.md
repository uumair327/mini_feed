**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Explicit error handling, type safety, composability
- ✅ **Pros**: No exceptions thrown, predictable error flow
- ❌ **Cons**: Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with functional programming
- ❌ **Cons**: More verbose than try-catch blocks

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Exception-based error handling: Familiar but less explicit
- Custom Result class: More control but reinventing the wheel
- Nullable return types: Simple but limited error information

### 8. Optimistic Updates Strategy

**Decision**: Implement optimistic updates for user actions

**Reasoning**:
- Improves perceived performance
- Better user experience
- Works well with offline functionality
- Reduces waiting time for user feedback

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Better UX, faster perceived performance
- ✅ **Pros**: Works well offline
- ❌ **Cons**: Complex rollback logic needed
- ❌ **Cons**: Potential for inconsistent state if sync fails

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pessimistic updates: Simpler but slower UX
