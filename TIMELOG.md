  - 178+ tests across entities, use cases, models, and data sources
  - Mocking strategies with mocktail
  - Error scenario testing

### Phase 5: Documentation & Artifacts (15 minutes)
- **Documentation** (10 min)
  - Comprehensive README with setup instructions
  - Architecture overview with Mermaid diagram
  - Decisions and trade-offs documentation

- **Project Artifacts** (5 min)
  - TIMELOG.md creation
  - Artifacts folder setup
  - Project structure documentation

## Total Development Time: ~3 hours 15 minutes

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Completed Features
- Complete Clean Architecture implementation
- Comprehensive error handling system
- Network layer with proper HTTP client
- Local storage with Hive and secure storage
- Domain entities with business logic
- Repository pattern implementation
- Use cases for all major features
- Data models with JSON serialization
- Hive models for local caching
- Remote data sources with API integration
- Local data sources with caching
- Extensive unit test coverage (178+ tests)

### ⚠️ Partially Completed
- Repository implementations (interfaces defined, implementations need completion)
- Data source method alignment with storage interfaces
- Integration between all layers

### ❌ Not Started
- Presentation layer (UI, BLoC state management)
- Integration tests
- APK build and screenshots
- End-to-end functionality testing

## Development Methodology

### Approach Used
- **Spec-driven development**: Started with requirements, design, and task planning
- **Test-driven development**: Wrote comprehensive unit tests alongside implementation
- **Layer-by-layer implementation**: Built from core infrastructure outward
- **Clean Architecture principles**: Maintained strict layer separation and dependency inversion

### Quality Measures
- **Code Coverage**: High unit test coverage across all implemented layers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with typed failures
- **Documentation**: Inline code documentation and architectural documentation
- **Type Safety**: Full null safety compliance
- **Code Quality**: Consistent formatting and linting rules

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Clean Architecture provided excellent structure and maintainability
- Comprehensive testing caught issues early in development
- Modular approach allowed for independent layer development
- Strong typing and error handling improved code reliability

### Challenges Encountered
- Interface alignment between storage services and data sources
- Complex dependency injection setup for testing
- Balancing abstraction levels without over-engineering
- Time constraints prevented full UI implementation

### Time Management
- **Efficient**: Core infrastructure and domain layer development
- **Moderate**: Data layer implementation with comprehensive testing
- **Challenging**: Debugging interface mismatches and test setup

## Next Steps (If Development Continued)

### Immediate Priorities (Next 2-3 hours)
1. Complete repository implementations
2. Fix data source interface alignment
3. Implement basic UI screens (Login, Feed, Post Details)
4. Add BLoC state management
5. Create integration tests

### Medium-term Goals (Next 5-10 hours)
1. Complete UI implementation with proper styling
2. Add offline sync functionality
3. Implement image handling and caching
4. Add comprehensive error handling in UI
5. Create widget and integration tests
6. Build and test APK

### Long-term Enhancements (10+ hours)
1. Add advanced features (push notifications, social interactions)
2. Implement proper authentication backend
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Create comprehensive documentation
5. Add accessibility features
6. Implement CI/CD pipeline
